# Term 3 Assignment 1 - Workbook

## 1. 	Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project

GitHub is a tried and tested tool for source control and has several features which assist with managing large projects. Some of the key features to ensure robust source control management include:

- **Version control integration** -  GitHub can track all changes made to a repository including some comments, dates and a comparison between the repository before and after the commit was made. 
- **Branch protection** - Ability to create separate branches to where the main functionailty of a program is kept. This allows developers to work on updates on a separate branch without impacting the operation of the main features. 
- **Pull requests** - With pull requests, GitHub makes collaborative coding easier. Developers can request modifications by submitting a pull request (PR), which team members can evaluate, comment on, and accept. Before merging into the main branch, this procedure guarantees code quality, peer review, and conformance to coding standards.
- **Security access and controls** - Granular access control is provided by GitHub, which enables administrators to specify permissions at the repository level for various roles (such as write, read, and admin) to guarantee that only authorised individuals can merge or modify important codebase sections.

There are also several other features offered by GitHub to ensure proper source control for projects, however the above are just some of the main key features developers would look for. How GitHub would be used in practise for a large scale project would be as follows:

1. A repository would be created at the beginning of a new project to act as the main database for where the live version of a project and it's features would be held. This can be considered the 'main' branch for a project in development and the live version of the program would sit here.
